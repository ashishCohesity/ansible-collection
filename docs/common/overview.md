This project provides an Ansible collection for interacting with [Cohesity DataPlatform](https://www.cohesity.com/products/data-platform).

Leveraging Python, this Ansible collection can be used on Windows, Linux, or MacOS.

It includes modules, tasks, and example plays that are useful for automating common tasks in your environment.

The Cohesity Ansible Collection employs Cohesity's REST API to interact with Cohesity DataPlatform.
